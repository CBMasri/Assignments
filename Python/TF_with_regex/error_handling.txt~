ERROR HANDLING:

The following errors were handled within the formatter.py class:
1. WrongTypeException
Thrown when a command is given an inappropriate value, such as '?fmt' being
followed by something that is not 'on' or 'off'. The program will raise
the exception and inform the user of the line where the error has occurred.

2. ValueError
Thrown when the command given would go against given specifications, such
as margin being set beyond the pagewidth-20 or to less than 0. In either
case, a ValueError is raised and the user is informed of the line on which
the violation has occurred. (Because these errors were actually present in
the given test files, the code has been commented out so as to not interfere
with the testing of the program.

The following errors were handled within the sengfmt2.py script:
3. EmptyFileException
Thrown when the formatter is asked to look at a file that does not contain
any text. In this case, the program will inform the user and exit.

4. IndexError
Thrown when the user doesn't give a file as input when the program is run
from the command line. As per spec, the program then defaults to sys.stdin
for input.

5. OSError
Also thrown when there is no file given as input, and therefore defaults
to sys.stdin as well.

The following are additional errors that could be resolved but are not implemented:
6. TooManyCharsException
Thrown when the length of consecutive characters to be formatted exceeds the allowed
length of the line.

7. FileTooLargeError
Thrown when the program runs out of memory due to an exceedingly large input
file.

8. IOError
Thrown when the input file is given but cannot be opened for any reason.
