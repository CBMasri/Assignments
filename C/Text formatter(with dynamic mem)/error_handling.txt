ERROR HANDLING:

The following errors were HANDLED within the program:

1. Incorrect ?fmt command
Raised when fmt is given an inappropriate value, not 'on' or 'off'. The program will
inform the user of the error and exit.

2. Margin command out of spec
Thrown when the margin command given would go against given specifications.
Specifically, being set beyond the pagewidth-20 or to less than 0. In either
case, an error message occurs and the user is informed of the innapropriate 
value that margin has recieved. Because these errors were actually present in
the given test files, the code has been commented out so as to not interfere
with the testing of the program.

3. No input file given
Thrown when the user doesn't give a file as input when the program is run
from the command line. As per specifications, the program then defaults to stdin
for input.

4. No input given from stdin
An error message is displayed when there is no input recieved from stdin, and
the user is prompted once again to add input from stdin.

5. Unable to read file
This error message is displayed when an input file is given, but the file
cannot be read.

6. Invalid input
Thrown when the length of consecutive characters to be formatted exceeds the allowed
length of the line.

7. Memory allocation failure
This error is the most commonly handled within the program, and is raised when
any sort of dynamic memory allocation fails.
